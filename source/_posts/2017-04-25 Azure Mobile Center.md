After watching a YouTube video about ReactXP, I was reading about it in my phone and this video from React Conference auto played. It didn't have an interesting title, so I was about to turn it off, when I noticed it was big enough to be given it's own subdomain at Azure. 

Now, Microsoft is the king at making great dev tools, so I thought I should pay attention if this is their primary offering for mobile development on Azure.

It's awesome:

- First Class Support for React Native
- Analytics, Events, and Crash Reports that give stack traces in the original source code (using source maps)
- Code Push that is triggered by git deploy (Deploy changes directly to an installed app from the git release branch)

The video also showed some prototypes of some interesting testing tools. For example, he had the app open in multiple test devices and the UI events triggered on one device were synced to another device across the network (parallel testing).

I recommend watching the video and seeing the cool.
